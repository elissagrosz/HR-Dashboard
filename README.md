# Data Limitations
1. Some of the ages in the dataset were negative values (967 records). Therefore, these corresponding records were not used when querying. The queries used for analysis filtered the ages for only employees aged 18 and older.
2. Some of the term dates were far into the future and were not used for analysis (1562 records). The only term dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.
